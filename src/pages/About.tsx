              I'm so glad you're here to check out my portfolio and learn a bit
              about my passions and pastimes as well as professional experience.
              I'm proud to call Seattle home and love all everything about the
              Pacific Northwest. Please also have a look at my profile on{" "}

              Also! Please stop by periodically as I'm always working on
              personal projects (maybe some games, ground-breaking social media
              apps, etc.) that I'll always share and welcome any feedback on!

              Following my graduation from Washington State University in 2010
              with a BS degree in Environmental Science, I began my professional
              career with a small consulting firm in Yakima, Washington. My time
              in Yakima was with mixed feelings; the experience was invaluable
              and I worked with a great team, however the Seattle region has
              always been home and after a year in Yakima I was honored to
              accept a position with a Seattle-based firm. This small firm
              became a large firm in 2015 when we were aquired by a national
              Geotechnical and Environmental consulting firm based in Kansas.
              With the large firm came opportunity and I was able to grow my
              Industrial Hygiene career to the title of Project Manager. I was
              proud to manage projects and clients for both the public and
              private sectors. I learned to take ownership of projects from
              proposal to invoicing and close-out and work with a team to manage
              a dynamic schedule that often felt just one technician too short.

              With a growing desire to distance myself from the commerical
              construction industry, I also found an increasingly strong pull to
              create, and coupled with an interest in the seemingly endless
              possibilities offered by building with code, I began to think more
              seriously about where my aspirations could take me. In early 2022
              and after careful consideration, I decided to take the plunge and
              commit full-time to learning software development. A sixteen-week
              coding bootcamp may be the least amount of sleep I've ever
              survived on, but it gave me the skills to build, and build on
              learning. I'm excited at the prospect of working with a team to
              build real, deployed apps to reach users worldwide. I'm hungry to
              keep learning and can't wait to sink my teeth into a codebase that
              I can contribute to as well as learn from!

              I'm happy to call the Pacific Northwest home and have lived in Seattle for most of my adult life. When I'm not at the keyboard, I like to unplug and hit the trail for an overnight backpacking trip, go skiing when there's snow in the mountains, or get in the water and do some stand up paddling. I also love to travel and do my best to challenge my comfort zone in far off places!

              By my side for all my adventures is big cuddlebug mastiff/labrador named Chessa. She's into all the usual dog things (face licks, long walks to find sticks, and napping of course) but mostly she's just excited to be tagging along!
