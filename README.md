# A first go at building a React.js Portfolio Site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I also learned and incorporated TypeScript, Styled-Components and React Router v6 in the process of building this website.


## Future Plans:

- A major refactor of the file/components structure.
- Implementation of a styling solution (like MUI) for select User interactions.
- A __Contact__ page.
- More project links!
